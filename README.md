# linear-algebra-for-data-science

 Hey everyone,
 
I'm passionate about leveraging linear algebra in data science to tackle complex problems and extract valuable insights from data. My GitHub repositories house projects where I've applied linear algebra techniques to analyze data, build machine learning models, and optimize algorithms.

From matrix operations to eigenvalue decomposition, I'm constantly exploring how linear algebra concepts can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis pipelines.

Dive into my repositories to see how linear algebra fuels my journey in data science, and feel free to connect for discussions or collaborations!
